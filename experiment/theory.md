## RC Circuit

### Time Domain Response
#### From Our Earliar Lessons

Capacitor helps us make circuit that 'remember’ their recent history.This ability allows us to make ‘timing’ circuit – circuits that let ‘this’ happen a predetermined time after ‘that’ occurs.


#### Mathematical Notation

- A static description of the way a capacitor bhaves would be to say Q=CV,where Qis the total charge,C is a measure of how big the capacitor is and V is the voltage across it.
- A dynamic description ,ie one that changes with time would be to say I=C dV/dt. This is just the time derivative of the static description . C is constant wrt time,I is the rate at which charge flow .This essentially says – the bigger the current , the faster the capacitor’s voltage changes.

#### Analogy

Think of Capacitor as a tub that can hold charge . A tub of large diameter( C), holds a lot of water ( Q ) for a given height( V). If you fill the tub within a thin straw ( small I) then water level – V- will rise slowly. If you use a large pipe(large V) then water level will rise faster. Similar for draining (discharging )tub. Of course a tub of larger diameter takes longer to fill than a tub of smaller diameter.
