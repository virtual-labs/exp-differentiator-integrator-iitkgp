		<title>Charging with DC Source </title>
		<content>Charging with DC Source  Consider the circuit shown above where a DC source of 10V is applied to a Resistor of 1KOhms and a capacitor of 1 uF.  Assume Vcap is the voltage across the capacitor.   Vcap  </content>
		<related-content>Ask some questions like how changing values of R &amp; C can affect the charging time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The charge is flowing from the battery to the plates of the capcitor which means current is flowing&lt;br&gt;The voltage across the capacitor increases as the charge accumulates.&lt;br&gt;The voltage difference decreases.&lt;br&gt;The current now decreases because of the decreasing voltage difference.&lt;br&gt;Since the current increases the voltage across the capacitor which eventually decreases the current we can say the current leads voltage in a capacitor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Show the analogy in an animation. Capacitor is a water tank, voltage is the pressure, water is the current, pipe is the resistor. Size of the tank = value of the capacitor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</related-content>

		<title>Charging with DC Source </title>
		<content>Charging with DC Source  The Voltage across the capacitor approaches the applied voltage  - but at a rate that diminishes towards zero as Vcap approaches the applied voltage. It starts out strongly charging at 10mA but as it is 1V away it has slowed to 1/10 its rate.   </content>

		<title>Square Wave Response – slow change</title>
		<content>Square Wave Response – slow change Since we have seen that a time of 5T where T = R*C is needed for the capacitor to charge fully, let us first take a time period of the square wave large enough to charge the capacitor. So we take Time period of Square wave  &gt; &gt; RC. So in effect, this square wave is changing slowly.   </content>

		<content>Square Wave Response – fast change Since we have taken a source which changes slowly and allows the capacitor to charge/discharge fully, let us first take a time period of the square wave the changes fast now. So we take Time period of Square wave  &lt;&lt;  RC. Let us construct the circuit and observe its changes to this fast changing signal.  </content>
